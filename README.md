# Autoinstall_Netgui_Windows

This will try to crete in Ubuntu wsl2 a full development envoviroment by installing tools and making some changes to the Ubuntu WSL2 machine, it will install and prepare the enviroment the same way I would do it for my personal machine, so that you dont loose time installing and preparing everything.

Some thing it will do:
	Install Conda for python version managment -> And lateset pyton version
 	Install NPM(node packet manager) so that you can install latest version of node.js and work on javascript proyects
  	Adjust some of the VM settings
   	Install files
	Install tree
 	Enable dark mode on Ubuntu, by defalt apps are in the light profile that I dont personally like, this will make Ubuntu use the dark theme on all aps that support it like files for example
  	Install traceroute
   	Install jupyter notebook
    	Install Vmstat and htop
     	Install tcdump, bmon,
